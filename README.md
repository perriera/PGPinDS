>"Congratulations, you have completed your first lesson and hands-on lab in Python. However, there is one more thing you need to do. The Data Science community encourages sharing work. The best way to share and showcase your work is to share it on GitHub. By sharing your notebook on GitHub you are not only building your reputation with fellow data scientists, but you can also show it off when applying for a job. Even though this was your first piece of work, it is never too early to start building good habits. So, please read and follow this article to learn how to share your work."

Disclaimer - The projects have been built leveraging real publicly available data-sets of the mentioned organizations.

  
  
  
  

## KaTeX

  

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

  

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

  

$$

\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.

$$

  

> You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).

  
  

## UML diagrams

  

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

  

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?

Bob-->>John: How about you John?

Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!

Bob-x John: I am good thanks!

Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

  

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...

Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?

```

  

And this will produce a flow chart:

  

```mermaid

graph LR

A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))

A --> C(Round Rect)

B --> D{Rhombus}

C --> D

```
